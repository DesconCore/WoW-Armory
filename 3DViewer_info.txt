Attention!
Currently 3D Viewer is not yet fully completed - there's no saving character poses, full screen mode
and some other features.

To work correctly, you need to download an archive with the model textures (~297 MB compressed).

All files from archive must be unpacked to the 'models' folder. The unpacked files are approximately 465 megabytes.
Directory tree:
 - models
         |- bgs
         |- character
         |- flash
         |- images
         |- item
                |- objectcomponents
                |- texturecomponents
         |- spells
